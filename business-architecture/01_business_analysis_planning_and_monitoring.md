01. Business Analysis Planning and Monitoring

1. Introduction

This document outlines the planning approach for the Business Analysis (BA) activities of the Alkyl programming language project. It defines the stakeholders, governance procedures, and information management tools required to guide the language's development from prototype to production.

2. Plan Business Analysis Approach

2.1. Approach Type

Adaptive (Agile/Iterative): Given the experimental nature of language design, Alkyl follows an iterative approach. Requirements are expected to evolve as implementation details regarding LLVM integration and type system constraints are discovered.

Release Cadence: Continuous delivery based on feature completion (e.g., "Structs Update", "Control Flow Update") rather than strict time-boxed sprints.

2.2. Complexity and Risk

Technical Complexity: High. Involves intricate interaction with low-level memory management and compiler backend generation.

Risk Level: Moderate. Main risks involve breaking changes in the LLVM C API and potential design flaws in the type system that require architectural rewrites.

3. Plan Stakeholder Engagement

3.1. Stakeholder Matrix

Role

Responsibility

Influence

Engagement Method

Core Maintainer(s)

Architecture decisions, code review, release management.

High

Direct commits, RFC approval.

Contributors

Standard library implementation, bug fixes, compiler optimizations.

Medium

Pull Requests, Issues.

Early Adopters

Testing alpha versions, providing feedback on syntax ergonomics.

Low

GitHub Discussions, Discord.

LLVM Community

Upstream dependency providers.

High (External)

Documentation, Mailing Lists.

4. Plan Business Analysis Governance

4.1. Decision Making

RFC Process: Major language changes (syntax additions, changing memory models) must go through a Request For Comments (RFC) process on GitHub before implementation.

Benevolent Dictator (BDFL): Final tie-breaking decisions on syntax ambiguity rest with the Lead Developer/Maintainer.

4.2. Change Control

Version Control: Git tags and Semantic Versioning (SemVer) will be used to manage releases.

Breaking Changes: Strictly documented in CHANGELOG.md.

5. Plan Information Management

Repository: All requirements, design docs, and code reside in the primary Git repository.

Traceability: Use of Git commit messages referencing Issue IDs (e.g., "Fixes #42") to trace code back to requirements.

Documentation: Architecture docs (like this one) are stored in business-architecture/ and software-architecture/ directories alongside the source code.
