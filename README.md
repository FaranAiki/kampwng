# Alkyl Programming Language

Alkyl (previously from kampwng) is named after aikil (aiki language). But since that sucks, I renamed into alkyl which in chemistry, it is CnH2n+1.

A simple programming language written using LLVM-IR.

Core feature is the high-level and simplicity of C, combined with C++'s object oriented programming with is-a has-a feature.

Todo implemented:
* threading { }
* inert so that inert entities cannot be has-ed
