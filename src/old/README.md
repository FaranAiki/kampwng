# What is .old/ Folder?

This is a folder that contains previously made components that either 
* 
* not used
* used to optimize
* not really relevant

**Note: Yes, that is why you do not vibe code so that you really know the step of compilation**

*I will not blame myself as I did not, and will not, take the design compilator*
