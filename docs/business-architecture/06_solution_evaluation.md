# Solution Evaluation

generated by AI

## 1. Introduction

This document assesses the performance and value of the solution (the Alkyl Compiler and Ecosystem) to determine if it is meeting the business goals. It focuses on analyzing the actual output rather than the theoretical design.

## 2. Measure Solution Performance

### 2.1. Performance Metrics

(this is bullshit lol ai sucks)
Compilation Speed: Measured in Lines of Code per Second (LOC/s). Goal: >10k LOC/s.

Binary Size: Overhead of the runtime library linked into the final executable. Goal: <50KB overhead for "Hello World".

Runtime Performance: Execution speed compared to equivalent C programs (-O3 optimization).

### 2.2. Quality Metrics

Pass Rate: Percentage of tests in code/test/ passing.

Stability: Frequency of compiler crashes (Segfaults) during normal usage.

## 3. Analyze Performance Measures

### 3.1 Current Bottlenecks

String Handling: Current string implementation might involve excessive copying.

Error Recovery: The parser may stop at the first error, limiting developer productivity (needs "panic mode" recovery).

## 4. Assess Solution Limitations

### 4.1 Internal Limitations

Platform Dependency: Currently heavily tied to specific POSIX system calls in lib/std, limiting Windows portability without further abstraction.

Memory Safety: While safer than C, manual memory management still allows Use-After-Free bugs if defer is misused.

### 4.2 External Limitations

LLVM Versioning: Changes in LLVM's C API across major versions (14 -> 15 -> 16) often break the backend binding code.

## 5 Recommend Actions to Increase Solution Value

### 5.1 Optimization Plan

(?)
Implement Object Caching: Avoid re-compiling unchanged modules to speed up incremental builds.

Expand Diagnostics: Add "Did you mean?" suggestions for typos to improve user experience.

### 5.2 Retirement Plan

(?)
Legacy Features: Deprecate old_syntax immediately if it conflicts with new parser rules.

Transitional Code: Remove temporary printf debugging from the compiler source once the debugger integration is stable.

## If

So far good.

## While

So far good.

## Array 

Bad. TODO learn GEP

## String 

Not that bad.

## For
