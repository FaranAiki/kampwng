# Alkyl as Business for Requirement Life Cycle Management

generated by AI

## 1. Introduction

This document defines how requirements for Alkyl are maintained, prioritized, and traced throughout the lifecycle of the project, ensuring that development efforts align with the strategic goals defined in the Strategy Analysis.

## 2. Trace Requirements

### 2.1 Traceability Matrix

Requirements are traced implicitly through the development toolchain:

Business Goal: "Better C Interoperability"

Feature: externC keyword.

Test Case: code/test/extern_test.aky.

Implementation: src/codegen/foreign.c.

## 3. Maintain Requirements

### 3.1 Maintenance Strategy

Living Documentation: This Business Architecture folder is updated whenever the strategic direction shifts (e.g., deciding to support a Garbage Collector would fundamentally change these docs).

Backlog Grooming: Closing stale issues and deprecating planned features that no longer fit the language philosophy.

## 4. Prioritize Requirements

### 4.1 Prioritization Method (MoSCoW)

#### Must Have (Critical):

Correct LLVM IR generation.

Basic control flow (if, while, return).

Struct/Union data layout compatibility with C.

#### Should Have (Important):

Comprehensive Standard Library (std::file, std::net).

Language Server Protocol (LSP) support.

#### Could Have (Desirable):

REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop).

Self-hosting compiler.

#### Won't Have (Out of Scope):

Runtime Virtual Machine (Alkyl is AOT compiled).

Complex inheritance/polymorphism (prefer composition).

## 5. Assess Requirements Changes

### 5.1. Impact Analysis

When a requirement changes (e.g., changing the syntax for function pointers):

Parser Impact: Update tree-sitter grammar and src/parser.

Codegen Impact: Verify LLVM type generation.

User Impact: Existing code in lib/std or examples must be rewritten.

Action: Breaking changes require a version bump (0.1 -> 0.2).

Requirement:
* lexer 
* parser
* codegen
