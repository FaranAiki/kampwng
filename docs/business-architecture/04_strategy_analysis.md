# Alkyl for Business in Strategy Analysis

## 1. Introduction (BABOK) What-is
Strategy Analysis KA in BABOK focuses on the "Business Architecture" of the Alkyl programming language. It defines the strategic direction, identifies the gap between the current state (early development) & the future state (production-ready systems language), and assesses the risks associated with bridging that gap.

## 2. Analyze Current State (As-Is)

### 2.1 Project Maturity (Current State)

Half support for self-hosting/bootstrapping.

### 2.2 Organizational Structure

Made by a person. However, the codebase can be expanded as it is open source.

### 2.3 Code Format 

Heavily vibecoded, although some are manual debugging and writing.

## 3. Define Future State (To-Be)

### 3.1 Pragmatic Hope

To establish Alkyl as a pragmatic, high-performance systems programming language that offers seamless C interoperability, modern syntax ergonomics, and robust type safety, serving as a langauge that can barrier Artificial Intelligence with Human Intelligence.

### 3.2 Nearby Future

Alkyl is capable of compiling itself and no obvious bug/undefined behavior.

### 3.3 Capability Matrix

Here is the matrix 

## 4. Assess Risks 

Here is the matrix 

## 5. Define Change Strategy


### Transition Plan 

The transition from the current prototype to the future stable release will follow an iterative strategy:
* **Stabilization phase** with comprehensive unit testing, and complete the C-interop layer.
* **Bootstrap phase** by beginning rewriting core standard library components in Alkyl.
* **Tooling phase** by developing LSP (like tree-sitter) for editor support, especially NVChad.
* **Release phase** where it is fully stable.

### Value Streams

For developer, it is from code authoring, rapid compilation, to diagnostics/immediate feedback.
For system integration, interface definition to C bindings then linkage.
