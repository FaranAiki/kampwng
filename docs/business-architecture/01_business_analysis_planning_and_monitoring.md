# Business Analysis Planning and Monitoring

generated by AI

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the planning approach for the Business Analysis (BA) activities of the Alkyl programming language project. It defines the stakeholders, governance procedures, and information management tools required to guide the language's development from prototype to production although as-is still Faran Aiki himself. This is just yapping to standardize the format of Alkyl programming language viewed as a business enterprise.

## 2. Plan Business Analysis Approach

### 2.1 Approach Type

Alkyl use **agile** approach as it is experimental. Continuous delivery based on feature completion (e.g., "Structs Update", "Control Flow Update") rather than strict time-boxed sprints.

### 2.2 Complexity and Risk

Technical Complexity involves intricate interaction with low-level memory management and compiler backend generation, albeit the initial releases are just vibe-coding, or to be precise, AI-driven programming.

Main risks involve breaking changes in the LLVM C API and potential design flaws in the type system that require architectural rewrites.

## 3. Plan Stakeholder Engagement

### 3.1. Stakeholder Matrix

TODO

## 4. Plan Business Analysis Governance

### 4.1 Decision Making

TODO 

### 4.2 Change Control

Version Control uses git tags and semantic versioning (SemVer) will be used to manage releases although inconsistenly.

Strictly documented in CHANGELOG.md.

## 5. Plan Information Management

* Repository: All requirements, design docs, and code reside in the primary Git repository.

* Traceability: Use of Git commit messages referencing Issue IDs (e.g., "Fixes #42") to trace code back to requirements.

* Documentation: Architecture docs (like this one) are stored in business-architecture/ and software-architecture/ directories alongside the source code.
